# Boat Cannon Feature Implementation
If I were to implement the cannon feature for the sailing game again, here's how I would approach it:
Overview of the Feature
The cannon feature transforms the sailing simulator into a naval combat game by allowing players to fire cannons from both sides of their boat at enemy vessels. When a boat takes enough damage, it explodes dramatically and respawns elsewhere.
Key Components
1. 3D Models and Visualization
Boat Cannons: Black cylindrical models mounted on both sides of the boat hull
Cannonballs: Spherical projectiles with physics-based trajectories
Explosion Effects: Fire and smoke particle systems that activate when boats are destroyed
2. Gameplay Mechanics
Firing Controls: 'Q' and 'E' keys for firing left and right cannons respectively
Mobile Controls: Touch buttons for mobile device compatibility
Cooldown System: 0.5-second delay between cannon shots to prevent spamming
Heel-Angle Physics: Cannonball trajectories affected by boat's current heel angle
Damage System: Boats have health points and are destroyed when health reaches zero
Respawn System: Destroyed boats reappear at a new location after being sunk
3. Multiplayer Integration
Network Messages: Synchronized cannon fire, hits, and explosions across clients
Server Validation: Server-side hit detection to prevent cheating
