# Sail

A browser-based sailing simulator built with Three.js that demonstrates basic sailing physics and controls.

## Features

- 3D sailing environment with water, sky, and islands
- Realistic sailing physics (simplified)
- Control the rudder with A/D keys
- Adjust sail trim with Left/Right arrow keys
- Wind visualization with particles and flag
- Compass showing north direction
- Speed indicator

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. No server or build process required!

## Controls

- **A/D keys**: Control the rudder (turn left/right)
- **Left/Right arrow keys**: Adjust sail trim

## Sailing Tips

- The sail works best when positioned at approximately 90 degrees to the wind
- Watch the flag on top of the mast to see the relative wind direction
- Use the compass to navigate around the islands
- Adjust your sail trim as you change direction relative to the wind

## Technical Details

This simulator is built as a single HTML file using:

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Custom sailing physics
- CSS for UI elements

The entire application is contained in a single HTML file for simplicity.
