# Improvements

## UI
- Add vector informations system to show forces acting on boat

## Physics
- Implement realistic quadratic drag force (F = -kvÂ²) to create natural speed limit
- Fine-tune drag coefficient to achieve balanced maximum velocity

## Combat System
- Add broadside cannons mounted on port and starboard sides
- Implement parabolic cannonball trajectories with proper physics
- Create target practice system with scoring
- Add visual effects for cannon fire and impacts
