# MY TODO

## usage


## UI
- [ ] restore the force vectors
- [ ] restore the in person camera
- [ ] more realistic sea. maybe an animation.
- [ ] add flag on top of the boat. that follows the wind direction. with the country of the prson that joins.


## Physics


## Combat System
- [] Add broadside cannons mounted on port and starboard sides
- [ ] Implement parabolic cannonball trajectories with proper physics
- [ ] Create target practice system with scoring
- [ ] Add visual effects for cannon fire and impacts




# REDDIT TO-DO LIST

## Core Physics Fixes
- [ ] Fix wind force calculation (boat should still be pushed downwind when facing upwind).  
- [ ] Implement proper sail reaction when wind hits from the front (fluffing, realistic tacking).  
- [ ] Improve drag forces: add proper hull drag and fix incorrect force orientations.  
- [ ] Add side forces for hull to prevent unrealistic rail-like movement.  
- [ ] Adjust boat weight/momentum to prevent slow acceleration/deceleration.  
- [ ] Improve heeling mechanics based on wind force and sail angle.  

## Sailing Mechanics  
- [ ] Allow boat sail plan configuration (e.g., support cat ketch).  
- [ ] Implement automatic sail movement when crossing the wind.  
- [ ] Replace direct sail control with realistic sheet-in and sheet-out mechanics.  
- [ ] Switch from real wind to apparent wind for better physics.  
- [ ] Add a point-of-sail indicator for easier wind navigation.  

##  Gameplay & UI  
- [ ] Implement collision detection for islands (running aground should stop the boat).  
- [ ] Add dynamic wind changes (speed & direction shifts over time).  
- [ ] Display full vector breakdown for keel and sail forces.  
- [ ] Improve sail control UI (replace stick control with a more realistic rope system).  
- [ ] Enhance first-person view with better interaction.  

##  Advanced Features (Future)  
- [ ] Connect to real-world wind data for dynamic weather.  
- [ ] Add sail failures (accidental jibes, capsizing).  
- [ ] Consider VR support for a more immersive experience.  
- [ ] Improve water realism (waves, current effects).
